Setup:

You will need a material scanner, a text display, and a button. The text display should be named Scan in order for the script to run without changes. The button should be named SO (I use a 12x12 button instead of a hybrid button to save space on my dashboard, but you can use virtually any 1/0 toggle).

On the material scanner, all of the fields will need to be renamed. The names for each field should be:

Active -> SO
Index -> Id
ScanResults -> SR
Material -> Ma
Volume -> Vk
Scan -> SS
Reset -> SRe
The yolol script can be run on a basic chip, and is the following lines:

IF :SO==0 THEN :Scan="\nNO RESULTS" goto 1 ELSE :Id=0 END :SRe=1 i=0
n="\n" IF :SR>0 THEN o="" i=0 goto 3 ELSE :SS=1 goto 1 END
IF i<3 THEN i+=1 ELSE i=0 goto 6 END
IF :Id<:SR THEN goto 5 ELSE goto 3 END
IF :Vk>0 THEN o+=n+:Ma+n+(:Vk/1728)+" stacks" :Id+=1 goto 3 END 
:Scan=o IF :Id<:SR THEN o="" goto 3 END goto 1
The scanner will constantly scan, updating when it scans something successfully. If there are more than 3 components, the component list will be broken down into pages of 3 that display for about a half second each.
